We are a motivated Student Cluster Competition Team at Nanchang University, has participated in the ASC Student Supercomputer Challenge for 8 years. As the host of the finals in 2018, our school welcomed excellent supercomputing talents from all over the world. Our best result in ASC is the first prize.Now, we are trying to challenge the broader boundaries of supercomputing and attempting to establish extensive connections with more supercomputing universities.

Nanchang University is the only 211 project university in Jiangxi Province, which devotes significant efforts to computer science research, especially on high-performance computing (HPC). HPC enables the blossom of Artificial Intelligence and Data-intensive business nowadays. Thus, HPC shall be considered as the foundation of the cutting-edge computer science and technique. Nanchang University has already investigated and successfully built the largest distributed high-performance clusters for educational purpose in the mid-west region of China. The peak performance is 100 TFlop, based on a carefully-designed heterogeneous architecture. Till the end of 2019, we have purchased over 6 million CNY on computing servers from Inspur and other manufacturers, and plan to keep investigating more on hardware in the near future.

## 2023

We are going to participate in SC23 SCC in Denver.
